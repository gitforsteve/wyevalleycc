        <p>In May 2019 Monmouthshire County Council declared a climate emergency strategy and Tintern Community Council fully supports the aims of that strategy and acknowledges that action needs to be taken.</p>
        <p>You can <a href="https://www.monmouthshire.gov.uk/climate-emergency/" target="new">see the public article on the MCC web site here.</a></p>
        <h2 style="font-size:4vu;">Have YOU considered car sharing?</h2>
        <p>The number of separate cars travelling from Tintern to Bristol on a daily basis must be considerable and many commute to other destinations such as Cardiff, Newport, etc. A driver and three passengers saves three vehicles for the trip, reducing traffic, stress and, of course, cost.</p>
        <p><a href="https://liftshare.com/uk" target="new">Take a look at LiftShare</a> where you may find someone going your way.</p>
        <h2 style="font-size:4vu;">Can you think of any other ideas to reduce the impact?</h2>
        <p>If you can then please <a href="contact.php">get in touch with your Councillor</a> and let us know.</p>
