<p>NOTES</p>
<p>Community and town councils in our group must pay their members &pound;156 a year (equivalent to &pound;3 a week) towards the extra household expenses (including heating, lighting, power and broadband) of working from home unless the Councillor opts out of the payment.</p>
<p>Councils must either pay their members Â£52 a year for the cost of office consumables required to carry out their role, or alternatively councils must enable members to claim full reimbursement for the cost of their office consumables.</p>
<p>Community and town councils in our group can make an annual payment of up to &pound;500 to up to 3 members in recognition of specific responsibilities. This is in addition to the &pound;156 towards the extra household expenses of working from home and the &pound;52 a year for the cost of office consumables required to carry out their role.

</p>
<p>Note that these rules are due to change before our next statement.</p>
