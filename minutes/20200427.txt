A466 Future Closure - Update received from Steve Baldwin, MCC on 9th April saying the Consultant had put together a project programme on an assumed response from NRW.  6th July 2020 has been identified as the latest possible start date but due to NRW's staffing availability during the crisis it looks as if the work will be delayed until next year.  Further update received 27th April confirming that MCC are still in a position that they will not be able to commence the works in the current financial year and at the moment have no option but to delay the works until the 2021/22 financial year.
Restricted Byway 389/49/1 leading into Barbadoes Woods - Richard Garner, MCC Rights of Way Officer reported back that the tree itself is the responsibility of the landowner to deal with but first discussing it with MCC.  He has asked his Field Officers to update Mr Carter as to the short term works needed to reinforce the bund to prevent further water flooding his property.
