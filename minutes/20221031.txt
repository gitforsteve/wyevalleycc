3388.   Updates:-   
Report from MCC on proposed 20mph speed limit in Llandogo – Mark Hand, MCC present to give update on proposed Llandogo village speed limit changes. He reported that there had been mixed feeling from the earlier public meeting.  Several modifications have been made to the original plan, which he circulated.  There is currently an initial proposal for double white lines down the centre of A466, but Police would be approval needed if this were to be implemented.  There will be a consultation next month followed by Cabinet decision early January 2023.  The experimental 20mph limit in Tintern is to be made permanent.  Cllr Evans stated the Tintern 20mph limit has made no difference and no Police presence has been seen.  Mr Hand reported that all residential streets in Wales will become standard 20mph next year.  
He was then asked if WVCC’s request to MCC to compulsory purchase the former Abbey Hotel had been considered.  He explained that a CPO was unlikely due to budget restraints.  
Technically MCC could use its CPO powers and enter into a back-to-back agreement with WVCC so it transfers to them to repair/restore the building and secure its future.  There is a 215 Notice on the property relating to the condition of the property.  
Dog Bin Emptying Contract – Update from MCC reporting two bids for the contract were received, but both unsuitable.  On-line meeting 6th October to discuss the way forward. Following meeting no suitable contractor was found so several options now suggested.
Wye Valley Villages Steering Group – All member nominations from each community council now in, next meeting 23rd November.  Cllr Mawdsley will attend. 
Wye Valley Villages Gateway Signage update – Signs now manufactured and delivered to MCC’s Highways Depot.  Installation hopefully towards end of October. Virtual meeting with consultants held 26th October, presentation showing the draft design concepts circulated to councils.  Feedback and comments by 1st November.  
Draft Visitor Signage Audit Report – Received from MCC. Next meeting 26th October.

3389.	To receive Reports from outside bodies:-
Village Halls – Llandogo - New boiler installed.   Tintern - Playground fund raising has been successful and now well over their target.  They have received a postcode lottery grant of £15,000.   The quiz raised over £600.                    
Llandogo School – Request received for a donation towards Virtual Reality Equipment at the School.  As £1,000 had been set aside for Education Grants Councillors approved payment.
Tintern & Llandogo Churches – Request from Llandogo Church for funding towards new boiler in Severy/Kitchen at a cost of £169.99 + VAT.  As the sum of £500 has been budgeted for towards works associated with the new servery & replacement hot water heater payment was agreed by Cllrs when the invoice is received.

3390.	Reports from Sub-Committees:- Finance.  Report back from Finance Committee Meeting.  Finance Committee had met on 28th September.  The amount to be given towards Charities was discussed as £1,500 had been set aside in the budget, mainly due to the fact that TUCC in the past paid £3,500 to CAB.   Councillors were asked for suggestions who the remainder should be donated to.

3391.  Discuss amount from reserves applicable to Penterry Ward:  Based on a total of 30 households the sum of £1,168.20 has been calculated as due to both former Penterry Wards.  £623.04 for 16 households due to St Arvans and £545.16 for 14 households due to Devauden Community Councils. Councillors approved this payment.

3392.  Discuss assisting Devauden CC with replacement of The Cot Noticeboard: Email received from Clerk of Devauden CC stating the noticeboard at The Cot is in a poor condition and asking if WVCC would be willing to help fund a new board.  Cllrs felt that as an amount from reserves was due to Devauden CC due to the boundary change this could be put towards helping fund the new board.

3393.  Discuss replacement of Tintern Village Hall Noticeboard:  It has been reported that this is in a very bad state of repair.  All Cllrs agreed to the Clerk ordering a new board.

3394.   Correspondence:  Email from MCC re Sustainable Landscape Funding available to Village Halls.  Passed on to the Village Halls.

3395.	Any Other Business:   Cllr Parker asked when the Councillor Allowance is paid as it is mandated that all Cllrs receive a payment unless they opt out.  Cllrs asked to state whether they wish for payment or to opt out by the next meeting.
