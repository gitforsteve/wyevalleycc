Presentation by representatives from Friends of the Lower Wye:  They have started a pressure group called Friends of the Lower Wye aimed to campaign to get the River Wye restored to a healthier state.  The condition of the river has got significantly worse over the last few years with extreme cases of algal bloom over the last few summers.  They have found an interim solution which they are trying to get in motion.  Two-thirds of the problem appears to be from farms, one-third from sewerage with 263 hours of sewerage overflow into the Wye in one year.  Cllr Shewell asked what they want from TCC in respect of support.  Mr Dunsbee explained that Himalayan Balsam is also a problem and if TCC know any landowners who would like a work party to get together to pull this up on the river banks could TCC let them have details.  They would also like to plant natural wild flowers and trees along riverbanks to help soak up any nitrates on the land.  Cllr Shewell suggested that TCC raise the fact that they are not happy with the problem of the sewerage overflow with Welsh Water, ask for an explanation as to why there have been so many discharges of sewage and what steps are they taking to stop it happening in future.
