3679.	Any Other Business:  A few residents of Llandogo have mentioned that there is an accessibility issue in the park.  As the terrain is bumpy, on a slope and covered in grass, it is not easy for families with push chairs and wheelchairs to gain access to the park. We as a Community Council do not have the powers to do anything, but it was agreed we would contact MCC with a request they look into this as soon as possible to see if there is any action that can be taken.  County Cllr Webb agreed to liaise with them on this basis.   
The problem with large, unsuitable vehicles using the Freedom Road was raised again as Satnav directs vehicles up this road.  County Cllr Webb reported that this has been passed on to several members of MCC.  
The pavement coming into Tintern from Deadmans Corner in the Chepstow direction needs clearing of moss and debris.  County Cllr Webb will report.
