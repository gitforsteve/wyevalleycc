The pathway will be open from 1st April 2021 but the Tidenham Tunnel will only be open daytimes from April to September due to bat protection requirements.

Discussion regarding publishing of draft minutes:  Cllrs discussed whether a checked draft could be published before finalisation of the formal minutes at the following meeting.  Cllrs agreed they would prefer to stay at the current arrangement.<br /><br />3059.   Frequency of emptying dog waste bins:  There had been a problem with the bins being over used by waste other than dog waste and Cllr Richards has been monitoring the situation.  A decision needs to be made as to whether fortnightly emptying is enough. Cllr Richards is happy to continue checking the bins her end of the village if another Cllr could check the one by the Churchyard.  It was agreed to monitor the situation and discuss at next month's meeting.  Cllr Richards reported there had been a Give Dog Fouling the Red Card meeting which discussed dog waste and MCC's proposed consultation on Public Space Protection Orders, dispensers for bags, county-wide action days, and an App that monitors where people allow dogs to foul without clearing up.  Cllr Shewell stated, and all Councillors agreed, that whatever the case additional emptying may have to be arranged to prevent overflow of contents. <br /><br />3060.   Restricted Byways in the community:  Clerk & Chairman had received an email and phone call from a member of the public not residing in the TCC area querying why TCC were trying to get these routes closed as he felt TCC were unfairly prejudiced against off-road vehicles.  After speaking to the Chairman he was asked to email his concerns. He now states he is pursuing alternative avenues.  <br /><br />3061.   Correspondence:    Email from Matthew Lewis, MCC asking if any Tintern businesses with parking that will be closed over Easter would be willing to allow visitors to park in their spaces.  He asked whether Cllrs have any issues with the proposal.  Cllr Richards will report back that Cllrs felt it was up to the individual businesses.  County Cllr Webb suggested perhaps a Park & Ride from Chepstow Racecourse on busy weekends would be a good idea.  Cllr Richards commented that this had been discussed at Fete Committee meetings.  Cllr Evans also reported the Wye Valley Road Safety have also discussed this.<br /><br />3062.Any Other Business:  AONB are starting a new project in Chapel Hill Road. This is part of a project to help resolve long-standing water management issues and damage to specific public rights of way and highways in the Lower Wye Valley.  The Limekiln Brook catchment and Chapel Hill Road were prioritised and a pilot Natural Flood Management Scheme was designed which will be installed from the 29th March. The road will be closed for a 3 week period.  <br /><br />Email from Mark Hand, MCC notifying that an additional grant has been secured for the temporary pavement widening works outside Abbey Mill to be made permanent.  This will not now commence until week commencing 12th April for a week with traffic lights.  The work is entirely linked with the increased pedestrian and bicycle traffic coming over the Wye Bridge with the opening of the Greenways Route. Cllrs discussed the matter and were divided in their opinion.  Cllrs Richards & Evans will raise this at the Wye Valley Villages meeting tomorrow.  Clerk reply saying TCC object to this particular course of action and cannot accept the justification for widening this pavement only while they are not considering other dangerous, narrow pavements elsewhere in the village.  At a meeting some years ago with MCC it was agreed a plan would be considered to try and help improve this.  TCC would like a further meeting with MCC to discuss this.  <br /><br />Cllr Ashman reported he had received concerns from members of the community relating to works that appear to have commenced at Bay Cottage. TCC were pleased to note progress with the project.  It was also felt that an archaeologist should visit the site.  However, the Planning Enforcement Officer had already opened a case to investigate breaches.  Clerk & County Cllr Webb to follow this up. <br />Cllr Ashman also reported that the owners of the Wye Valley Hotel have asked when resurfacing work to the bottom of Trellech Road and their parking bay is going to be commenced.  County Cllr Webb reported that MCC carried out investigation work under the road and a report will be available in time for TCC's next meeting.  She has again requested a copy of the report from Paul Keeble.<br />Cllr Ashman received complaints about the outdoor take-away Caf which has opened at the Royal George Hotel.  There were a number of people seated on benches at the premises eating and drinking which is against Covid rules.  The Police were called to attend but nothing came up on the monthly report.  Clerk & County Cllr Webb to raise this with Police & Environmental Health.<br />Cllr Ashman also had reports of a Childrens Party going on last Saturday on the village hall playground with a large group attending.  Clerk to report these matters to the Police.<br />Cllr Ashman asked whether there was any time scale for the works to be carried out on the minor landslide on the A466 at the southern end of the village. County Cllr Webb reported that MCC hope to carry out the work while the second A466 closure is in place.<br />Cllr Ashman reported that he will arrange a meeting with the persons involved with the Tidal Power Project when Covid rules relax.<br />Cllr Cobb asked that TCC put a notice in the minutes thanking the Surgery for the rapid progress they have made in distributing the vaccine and thanking them for their efforts.<br />Cllr Evans thanked County Cllr Webb for the work she put in sorting out their wheelie bin collection for garden waste.  Due to the steepness of their drive this would have been impossible.<br />Cllr Richards once again raised the suggestion that MCC are asked if they could carry out some minor tidying up around the Abbey area.  County Cllr Webb reported she had taken photos and reported various things to MCC.  She also asked if the dog waste bin by the Abbey Roundabout could be moved slightly nearer the pavement.  Clerk ask Susan Parkinson if this is possible when they are relocating the litter bin to the Wireworks Bridge.<br />Cllr Shewell reported that there appears to be a mobile home on ground at Laymans View, on the southern end of the village.  Clerk has reported this to Enforcements.<br /><br />3063.Date of next meeting:  26th April.<br /><br />There being no further business the meeting closed at 20.32.
