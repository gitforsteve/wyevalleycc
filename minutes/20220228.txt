Wye Valley Villages Project - Adoption of Common Report, discuss budget and put forward two Councillors for the working group.  Following circulation of the report to Councillors the project was discussed at the meeting.  TCC had agreed not to set any money aside in the 2022/23 budget as they felt the original project had lost its way.  After discussion three Councillors did not support adoption of the report, the remainder felt it was too premature to make a decision given that our Council is going to radically change in May.  TCC therefore felt this should be re-visited when the new Council is formed.<br />Clerk reply to the effect - TCC are not in a position to make a decision until the newly constituted Council is formed and is currently unable to give full support to this project, Tintern being unlike any other village with a layout unsuitable for the ideas put forward. The sum of &pound;1,000 was set aside in the 2021/22 budget and this will still be available.<br /><br />3253.   Presentation on One Planet Development Scheme south of Medhope Nursery: Matt Dunn & Freyja Sears unable to attend the meeting due to a case of Covid.  They could attend the April meeting.  Clerk reply saying TCC feel it would be better if they attend when a new Council is formed.<br /><br />3254.   Fryer's Wharf Access:  Both roadways to the Church are designated as restricted byways therefore the possibility of re-designation of these routes needs to be looked into as there is no official vehicular access to the car park at Fryer's Wharf.
