  <li>GENERAL
    <ol class="dec">
      <li>These financial regulations govern the conduct of financial management by the council and may only be amended or varied by resolution of the council. Financial regulations must be observed in conjunction with the council’s standing orders.</li>
      <li>The council is responsible in law for ensuring that its financial management is adequate and effective and that the council has a sound system of internal control which facilitates the effective exercise of the council’s functions, including arrangements for the management of risk.</li>
      <li>The council’s accounting control systems must include measures:<br />
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">
	  &bull; for the timely production of accounts;<br />
	  &bull; that provide for the safe and efficient safeguarding of public money;<br />
	  &bull; to prevent and detect inaccuracy and fraud; and<br />
	  &bull; identifying the duties of officers.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>These financial regulations demonstrate how the council meets these responsibilities and requirements.</li>
      <li>At least once a year, prior to approving the Annual Governance Statement, the council must review the effectiveness of its system of internal control which shall be in accordance with proper practices.</li>
      <li>Any wilful breach of these Regulations by an employee will be considered to be an act of gross misconduct.</li>
      <li>Members of Council are expected to follow the instructions within these Regulations and not to entice employees to breach them. Failure to follow instructions within these Regulations may bring the office of Councillor into disrepute and may constitute a breach of the Code of Conduct.</li>
      <li>The Responsible Financial Officer (RFO) holds a statutory office to be appointed by the council. The Clerk has been appointed as RFO for this council and these regulations will apply accordingly.</li>
      <li>The RFO:<br />

	  &bull; produces financial management information as required by the council.<br />
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>The accounting records determined by the RFO shall be sufficient to show and explain the council’s transactions and to enable the RFO to ensure that any income and expenditure account and statement of balances, or record of receipts and payments and additional information, as the case may be, or management information prepared for the council from time to time comply with the Accounts and Audit Regulations pertaining to Wales.</li>
      <li>The accounting records determined by the RFO shall in particular contain:<br>
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">
	  &bull; entries from day to day of all sums of money received and expended by the council and the matters to which the income and expenditure or receipts and payments account relate;<br />
	  &bull; a record of the assets and liabilities of the council; and<br />
	  &bull; wherever relevant, a record of the council’s income and expenditure in relation to claims made, or to be made, for any contribution, grant or subsidy.<br />
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>The accounting control systems determined by the RFO shall include:<br />
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">
	  &bull; procedures to ensure that the financial transactions of the council are recorded as soon as reasonably practicable and as accurately and reasonably as possible;<br />		&bull; procedures to enable the prevention and detection of inaccuracies and fraud and the ability to reconstruct any lost records;<br />
	 &bull; identification of the duties of officers dealing with financial transactions and division of responsibilities of those officers in relation to significant transactions;<br />
	  &bull; procedures to ensure that uncollectable amounts, including any bad debts are not submitted to the council for approval to be written off except with the approval of the RFO and that the approvals are shown in the accounting records; and<br />
	  &bull; measures to ensure that risk is properly managed.<br />
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>The council is not empowered by these Regulations or otherwise to delegate certain specified decisions. In particular any decision regarding:<br />
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">
	  &bull; setting the final budget or the precept (Council Tax Requirement);<br />
	  &bull; approving accounting statements;<br />
	  &bull; approving an annual governance statement;<br />
	  &bull; borrowing;<br />
	  &bull; writing off bad debts;<br />
	  &bull; addressing recommendations in any report from the internal or external auditors, shall be a matter for the full council only.<br />
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>In addition the council must:<br />
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">
	  &bull; determine and keep under regular review the bank mandate for all council bank accounts;<br />
	  &bull; approve any grant or a single commitment in excess of &pound;5,000.<br />
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>In these financial regulations, references to the Accounts and Audit Regulations or ‘the regulations’ shall mean the regulations issued under the provisions of the Public Audit (Wales) Act 2004, or any superseding legislation, and then in force unless otherwise specified.<br />In these financial regulations the term ‘proper practice’ or ‘proper practices’ shall refer to guidance issued in Governance and Accountability for Local Councils in Wales - A Practitioners’ Guide, available from the web sites of One Voice Wales (OVW) and SLCC as appropriate.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT (INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL)
      <ol class="dec">
	<li>All accounting procedures and financial records of the council shall be determined by the RFO in accordance with the Accounts and Audit Regulations, appropriate Guidance and proper practices.</li>
	<li>The RFO shall complete the annual statement of accounts, annual report, and any related documents of the council contained in the Annual Return (as specified in proper practices) as soon as practicable after the end of the financial year and having certified the accounts shall submit them and report thereon to the council within the timescales set by the Accounts and Audit Regulations.</li>
	<li>The council shall ensure that there is an adequate and effective system of internal audit of its accounting records, and of its system of internal control in accordance with proper practices. Any officer or member of the council shall make available such documents and records as appear to the council to be necessary for the purpose of the audit and shall, as directed by the council, supply the RFO, internal auditor, or external auditor with such information and explanation as the council considers necessary for that purpose.</li>
	<li>The internal auditor shall be appointed by and shall carry out the work in relation to internal controls required by the council in accordance with proper practices.</li>
	<li>The internal auditor shall:<br />
	  <p style="margin-left:20px;">
	    &bull; be competent and independent of the financial operations of the council;<br />
	    &bull; report to council in writing, or in person, on a regular basis with a minimum of one annual written report during each financial year;<br />
	    &bull; to demonstrate competence, objectivity and independence, be free from any actual or perceived conflicts of interest, including those arising from family relationships; and<br />
	    &bull; have no involvement in the financial decision making, management or control of the council.<br />
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>Internal or external auditors may not under any circumstances:<br />
	  <p style="margin-left:20px;">
	    &bull; perform any operational duties for the council;<br />
	    &bull; initiate or approve accounting transactions; or<br />
	    &bull; direct the activities of any council employee, except to the extent that such employees have been appropriately assigned to assist the internal auditor.<br />
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>For the avoidance of doubt, in relation to internal audit the terms ‘independent’ and ‘independence’ shall have the same meaning as is described in proper practices.</li>
	<li>The RFO shall make arrangements for the exercise of electors’ rights in relation to the accounts including the opportunity to inspect the accounts, books, and vouchers and display or publish any notices and statements of account required by the Public Audit (Wales) Act 2004.</li>
	<li>The RFO shall, without undue delay, bring to the attention of all councillors any correspondence or report from internal or external auditors.</li>
      </ol>
  </li>

  <li>ANNUAL ESTIMATES (BUDGET) AND FORWARD PLANNING
    <ol class="dec">
      <li>The RFO must each year, by no later than January, prepare detailed estimates of all receipts and payments including the use of reserves and all sources of funding for the following financial year in the form of a budget to be considered by the council.</li>
      <li>The council shall consider annual budget proposals in relation to the council’s three year forecast of revenue and capital receipts and payments including recommendations for the use of reserves and sources of funding and update the forecast accordingly.</li>
      <li>The council shall fix the precept for the ensuing financial year not later than by the end of January each year. The RFO shall issue the precept to the billing authority and shall supply each member with a copy of the approved annual budget.</li>

    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>BUDGETARY CONTROL AND AUTHORITY TO SPEND
    <ol class="dec">
      <li>Expenditure on revenue items may be authorised up to the amounts included for that class of expenditure in the approved budget. This authority is to be determined by the council</li>
      <li>No expenditure may be authorised that will exceed the amount provided in the revenue budget for that class of expenditure other than by resolution of the council, or duly delegated committee. During the budget year and with the approval of council having considered fully the implications for public services, unspent and available amounts may be moved to other budget headings or to an earmarked reserve as appropriate (‘virement’).</li>
      <li>Unspent provisions in the revenue or capital budgets for completed projects shall not be carried forward to a subsequent year.</li>
      <li>In cases of extreme risk to the delivery of council services, the clerk may authorise revenue expenditure on behalf of the council which in the clerk’s judgement it is necessary to carry out. Such expenditure includes repair, replacement or other work, whether or not there is any budgetary provision for the expenditure, subject to a limit of £500. The Clerk shall report such action to the chairman as soon as possible and to the council as soon as practicable thereafter.</li>
      <li>No expenditure shall be authorised in relation to any capital project and no contract entered into or tender accepted involving capital expenditure unless the council is satisfied that the necessary funds are available and the requisite borrowing approval has been obtained.</li>
      <li>All capital works shall be administered in accordance with the council's standing orders and financial regulations relating to contracts.</li>
      <li>The RFO shall regularly provide the council with a statement of receipts and payments to date under each head of the budgets, and shall show explanations of material variances. For this purpose “material” shall be in excess of £100 or 15% of the budget.</li>
      <li>Changes in earmarked reserves shall be approved by council as part of the budgetary control process.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>BANKING ARRANGEMENTS AND AUTHORISATION OF PAYMENTS
    <ol class="dec">

      <li>The RFO shall prepare a schedule of payments requiring authorisation, forming part of the Agenda for the Meeting and, together with the relevant invoices, present the schedule to council. The council shall review the schedule for compliance and, having satisfied itself shall authorise payment by a resolution of the council. A detailed list of all payments shall be disclosed within or as an attachment to the minutes of the meeting at which payment was authorised. Personal payments (including salaries, wages, expenses and any payment made in relation to the termination of a contract of employment) may be summarised to remove public access to any personal information.</li>
      <li>All invoices for payment shall be examined, verified and certified by the RFO to confirm that the work, goods or services to which each invoice relates has been received, carried out, examined and represents expenditure previously approved by the council.</li>
      <li>The Clerk (RFO) shall have delegated authority to authorise the payment of items only if a payment is necessary to avoid a charge to interest under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998, and the due date for payment is before the next scheduled Meeting of council, where the Clerk and RFO certify that there is no dispute or other reason to delay payment, provided that a list of such payments shall be submitted to the next appropriate meeting of council.</li>
      <li>Members are subject to the Code of Conduct that has been adopted by the council and shall comply with the Code and Standing Orders when a decision to authorise or instruct payment is made in respect of a matter in which they have a disclosable pecuniary or other interest, unless a dispensation has been granted.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MAKING OF PAYMENTS
    <ol class="dec">
      <li>The council will make safe and efficient arrangements for the making of its payments.</li>
      <li>Following authorisation under Financial Regulation 5 above, the council, a duly delegated committee or, if so delegated, the Clerk or RFO shall give instruction that a payment shall be made.</li>
      <li>All payments shall be effected by cheque or other instructions to the council's bankers, or otherwise, in accordance with a resolution of Council.</li>
      <li>Cheques or orders for payment drawn on the bank account in accordance with the schedule as  presented to council or committee shall be signed by two members of council in accordance with a resolution instructing that payment. If a member who is also a bank signatory has declared a disclosable pecuniary interest, or has any other interest, in the matter in respect of which the payment is being made, that Councillor shall be required to consider Standing Orders, and thereby determine whether it is appropriate and / or permissible to be a signatory to the transaction in question. In most cases, the Councillor should not act as a signatory to such transactions.</li>
      <li>To indicate agreement of the details shown on the cheque with the counterfoil and the invoice or similar documentation, the signatories shall each also initial the cheque counterfoil.</li>
      <li>Cheques or orders for payment shall not normally be presented for signature other than at a council or committee meeting (including immediately before or after such a meeting). Any signatures obtained away from such meetings shall be reported to the council at the next convenient meeting.<li>
      <li>If thought appropriate by the council, payment for certain items may be made by BACS or CHAPS methods provided that the instructions for each payment are signed, or otherwise evidenced, by two authorised bank signatories. A record of these instructions must be retained and any payments reported to council as made. The approval of the use of BACS or CHAPS shall be renewed by resolution of the council at least every two years.</li>
      <li>If thought appropriate by the council, payment for certain items may be made by internet banking transfer provided evidence is retained showing which members approved the payment.<li>

The bank mandate will state clearly the amounts of payments that can be instructed by the use of the Service Administrator alone, or by the Service Administrator with a stated number of approvals.</li>
      <li>Access to any internet banking accounts will be directly to the access page (which may be saved under “favourites”), and not through a search engine or e-mail link. Remembered or savedpasswords facilities must not be used on any computer used for council banking work. Breach of this Regulation will be treated as a very serious matter and appropriate action will be taken including the use of the Council’s disciplinary procedure in the case of employees.</li>
      <li>Changes to account details for suppliers, which are used for internet banking may only be changed on written hard copy notification by the supplier and supported by hard copy authority for change signed by the Clerk and a member.
